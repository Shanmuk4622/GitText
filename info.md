# Git Test
this is a pratics file for git, 
# to update a file in an exiting reposetery we use ,
add - commit - git push origin main

# but to upload / create a reposetory 
afer creating a directory to get the features of hit you have to use a command
git init, to verify ls -Force (you will see .git)
go to my github account and create same reposetory in the directory name
add - commit - git remote add origin <-link->
"<>" this meant nothing required
1. git init, (to make features like git ), for ls -Force
2. git remote add origin https://github.com/Shanmuk4622/GitText.git || or git branch -M main || git push -u origin main
3. git remote -v  (to verify remote)
4. git branch  (checking branch)
5. git branch -M main   (changing branch to main)
6. git push origin main , But before that make sure your files are upto date
